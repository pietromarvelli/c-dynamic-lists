# Dynamic Lists in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of **dynamic linked lists in C**, including common operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and list reversal.  
The project was developed for educational purposes to better understand pointers, dynamic memory management, and basic data structures.

## Features

The program demonstrates the following linked-list operations:

- **Append** an element to the end of the list
- **Insert at the beginning of the list**  
- **Insert by position**  
- **Insert after a specific value**  
- **Remove the head element**  
- **Remove the last element**  
- **Remove by value**  
- **Remove by position**  
- **Reverse** the entire list  
- **Print** all elements  
- Proper handling of errors (e.g., invalid positions, missing values, empty list)
